        evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer

        rate-integrating gyroscope are compiled. This standard, when combined with
        IEEE Std 517-1974 (R1980), defines the requirements and test procedures in
        terms of characteristics unique to the gyroscope or those applications in
        which the dynamic angular inputs are significantly greater than the limitations

        for Nongyroscopic Inertial Angular Sensors: Jerk, Acceleration, Velocity,

        and test procedure for an inertial angular sensor that provides a common meeting
        ground of terminology and practice for manufacturers and users of an array
        of sensors that have been developed to meet needs not easily met by traditional
        spinning-rotor gyroscopes. A test procedure for verifying that the specifications
        have been met is given. The standard is not intended to compete with existing
        standards for specific devices with highly specific models and error sources,
        such as spring-restrained rate gyros, but to provide a uniform guide for those
        inertial angular sensors that have not been covered elsewhere. Learn More

        Dynamic Block Diagrams IEEE Std 671-1985 provides specifications and test
        requirements for a non-gyroscopic inertial angular sensor that may measure
        angular jerk, acceleration, rate, or displacement with or without response
        down to zero frequency. A standard specification format is provided. A compilation
        of recommended test procedures, derived from those presently used in the industry,
        is also provided. Informative annexes cover design features and theoretical
        principles of operation. This corrigendum makes changes to 4.7.2.6 to delete
        a sentence that does not belong there, to add a subclause that was inadvertently
        left out, and to renumber the existing subclauses. Changes are also being

        for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers This recommended
        practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision tests that are to
        be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques. The term
        u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted to
        evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer
        output complies with specific error limit criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        refers to tests that are conducted to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as
        opposed to those conducted to establish environmental survivability only.
        Evaluation may take the form of determining the coefficients of the accelerometer''s
        model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which are most accurately
        determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only

        refers to tests that are conducted to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as
        opposed to those conducted to establish environmental survivability only.
        Evaluation may take the form of determining the coefficients of the accelerometer''s
        model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which are most accurately
        determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only

        sensor in operating environments typical of aircraft and missile applications,
        and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform applications in which the dynamic
        angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected are benign relative to the accuracy
        required. In the case of the strap-down DTG, the characteristics of the external
        capture loops are considered to the extent necessary to define the gyro performance.

        missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform applications
        in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected are benign
