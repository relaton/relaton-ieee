        protection This amendment specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing
        IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external
        observers to correlate user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing

        an encapsulation format that allows one or more user data frames and padding
        octets to be carried within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating
        frames, hiding the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter
        can balance the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay
        by controlling the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted.

        Access Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency

        that allows one or more user data frames and padding octets to be carried
        within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating frames, hiding
        the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter can balance
        the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay by controlling
        the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted. YANG configuration

        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency
        with users identities and activities. It specifies an encapsulation format
        that allows one or more user data frames and padding octets to be carried
        within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating frames, hiding
        the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter can balance
        the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay by controlling
        the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted. YANG configuration

        Access Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency

        that allows one or more user data frames and padding octets to be carried
        within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating frames, hiding
        the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter can balance
        the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay by controlling
        the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted. YANG configuration
        and operational state models are defined both for the existing functionality
        of IEEE Std 802.1AE and for the functionality to be added by this project.

        Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a Link
        Aggregation Group, such that a Media Access Control (MAC) Client can treat
        the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies
        the establishment of data terminal equipu00adment (DTE) to DTE logical links,
        consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating
        at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent Link Aggregation
        capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support

        frames, hiding the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter
        can balance the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay
        by controlling the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted.

        the function of a MAC Relay with two MACs, and the protocols and procedures

        independent protocols except those explicitly addressed to this device. It
        is remotely manageable through at least one of its external MACs, and signals
        a failure of either MAC''s LAN through the other MAC. Learn More 802.1ak-2007

        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate

        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency

        This amendment specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE
        Std 802.1AE MAC Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external
        observers to correlate user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing
        and transmission frequency with users identities and activities. It specifies
        an encapsulation format that allows one or more user data frames and padding
        octets to be carried within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating
        frames, hiding the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter
        can balance the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay
        by controlling the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted.
        YANG configuration and operational state models are defined both for the existing
        functionality of IEEE Std 802.1AE and for the functionality to be added by
