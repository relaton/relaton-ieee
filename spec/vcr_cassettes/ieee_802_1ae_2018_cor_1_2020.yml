        protection This amendment specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing

        observers to correlate user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing

        an encapsulation format that allows one or more user data frames and padding
        octets to be carried within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating
        frames, hiding the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter
        can balance the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay
        by controlling the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted.

        Access Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency

        that allows one or more user data frames and padding octets to be carried
        within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating frames, hiding
        the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter can balance
        the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay by controlling
        the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted. YANG configuration

        between authenticated and authorized devices. This standard specifies a common
        architecture, functional elements, and protocols that support mutual authentication
        between the clients of ports attached to the same LAN and that secure communication

        the structure of IEEE 802 MAC addresses; it provides a standard for identification
        of public, private, prototype, and standard protocols; it specifies an object
        identifier hierarchy used within IEEE 802 for uniform allocation of object
        identifiers used in IEEE 802 standards; and it specifies a method for higher
        layer protocol identification. (The PDF of this standard is available at no

        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency
        with users identities and activities. It specifies an encapsulation format
        that allows one or more user data frames and padding octets to be carried
        within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating frames, hiding
        the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter can balance
        the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay by controlling
        the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted. YANG configuration

        Access Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency
        with users identities and activities. It specifies an encapsulation format
        that allows one or more user data frames and padding octets to be carried
        within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating frames, hiding
        the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter can balance
        the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay by controlling
        the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted. YANG configuration
        and operational state models are defined both for the existing functionality
        of IEEE Std 802.1AE and for the functionality to be added by this project.

        protection This amendment specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing
        IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external
        observers to correlate user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing

        an encapsulation format that allows one or more user data frames and padding
        octets to be carried within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating
        frames, hiding the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter
        can balance the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay
        by controlling the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted.

        IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks--Link Aggregation Link
        Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a Link
        Aggregation Group, such that a Media Access Control (MAC) Client can treat
        the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies
        the establishment of data terminal equipu00adment (DTE) to DTE logical links,
        consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating
        at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent Link Aggregation
        capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support
        link aggregation. Learn More 802.1AX-2014 IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan
        area networks -- Link Aggregation MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability
        and general information relevant to specific MAC types are defined in this

        to be used as if they were a single link and also supports the use of multiple
        links as a resilient load sharing interconnect between multiple nodes in two
        separately administered networks. (The PDF of this standard is available at

        Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate

        between authenticated and authorized devices. This standard specifies a common
        architecture, functional elements, and protocols that support mutual authentication
        between the clients of ports attached to the same LAN and that secure communication
        between the ports, including the media access method independent protocols

        Access Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency

        Access Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency
