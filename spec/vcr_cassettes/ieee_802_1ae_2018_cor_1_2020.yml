        Access Control (MAC) Security Amendment 4: MAC Privacy protection This amendment
        specifies privacy enhancements that complement existing IEEE Std 802.1AE MAC
        Security capabilities, and reduce the ability of external observers to correlate
        user data frames, their sizes, transmission timing and transmission frequency
        with users identities and activities. It specifies an encapsulation format
        that allows one or more user data frames and padding octets to be carried
        within the confidentiality protected data of consolidating frames, hiding
        the users MAC addresses and original frame sizes. The transmitter can balance
        the privacy improvement against the loss of efficiency and delay by controlling
        the sizes of consolidating frames and when they are transmitted. YANG configuration
        and operational state models are defined both for the existing functionality
        of IEEE Std 802.1AE and for the functionality to be added by this project.
        An SNMP MIB will be defined for the added functionality. This amendment also

        Link Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form
        a Link Aggregation Group, such that a Media Access Control (MAC) Client can
        treat the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end,
        it specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical
        links, consisting of N parallel instances of full-duplex, point-to-point links
        operating at the same data rate. The MAC independent Link Aggregation capability,

        control makes use of the physical access characteristics of IEEE 802 Local
        Area Networks (LAN) infrastructures in order to provide a means of authenticating
        and authorizing devices attached to a LAN port that has point-to-point connection
        characteristics, and of preventing access to that port in cases in which the
        authentication and authorization process fails. Learn More 802.1X-2010 IEEE

        Control Port-based network access control allows a network administrator to
        restrict the use of IEEE 802 LAN service access points (ports) to secure communication
        between authenticated and authorized devices. This standard specifies a common
        architecture, functional elements, and protocols that support mutual authentication
        between the clients of ports attached to the same LAN and that secure communication
        between the ports, including the media access method independent protocols
        that are used to discover and establish the security associations used by
        IEEE 802.1AE MAC Security. Learn More 802.1Xbx-2014 IEEE Standard for Local
